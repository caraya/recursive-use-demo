    <h1 class="recursive-b025-sans-casual-bold">Recursive Demo</h1>

    <p>
      The idea is to test Recursive in different contexts and under different circumstances. I'm particularly interested in the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>How do make a text follow a named instance?</li>
      <li>
        How the different named instances and OpenType features work together
      </li>
      <li>How does the monospaced family work with code?</li>
      <li>
        Does the monospaced fonts affect tools like Highlight.js or Prism?
      </li>
      <li>How does the font work at larger sizes?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="recursive-b025-sans-casual-black">
      How do we add named instances to the text?
    </h2>

    <p>
      There are two ways to woork with variable fonts predefined instances. The
      first one only works if you're generating classes for the instances. For
      example, the following code will use the
      <code>recursive-b025-sans-casual-bold</code> pre-defined instance
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-css">&lt;h2 class="recursive-b025-sans-casual-bold">How do we add named instances to
the text?&lt;/h2></code></pre>

    <p>
      So, in theory, we just select the class associated with the named instance
      and add it to the element or to a parent container like <code>div</code>,
      <code>section</code> or <code>article</code> and that's all we need to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another option is to use
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS Custom Properties</a>to define the default for properties and then use <code>font-variation-settings</code> to set them all at once. Because of a limitation of cascading font-variant-settings, this is the best way to do it if you don't want to re-write the entire rules every time any individual value changes.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-css">:root {
  --vf-mono: "MONO" 0;
  --vf-casl: "CASL" 1;
  --vf-slnt: "slnt" 0
  --vf-ital: "ital" 0.5;
  --vf-weight: 400;
  font-weight: var(--vf-weight);
  font-variation-settings:    var(--vf-mono),
                              var(--vf-casl),
                              var(--vf-slant);
                              var(--vf-ital);
  }</code></pre>

    <p>
      The hardest way to use a variable font is to modify
      <code>font-variation-settings</code> for all the axes that don't have a
      corresponding CSS property. In the example below,
      <code>font-weight</code> represents the <code>wght</code> axis but all the
      other axes need to go inside <code>font-variation-settings</code> either
      because they are custom axes (MONO and CASL) or because we want to avoid
      conflicts (slnt and ital).
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-css">.byline-credit {
  font-weight: 300;
  font-variation-settings: "MONO" 0, "CASL" 0, "slnt" -15, "ital" 1;
}</code></pre>

    <p>You can combine the variable font rules with additional classes for OpenType features or other elements of your design and layout.</p>

    <h2>Does it work with syntax highlighters?</h2>

    <p>
      I modified the styles for Prism.js to acommodate Recursive Mono as the
      default font for highlighted code. We put Recursive first in the
      <code>font-family</code> and we add a set of default values for
      <code>font-variation-settings</code>. You can see the results throughout
      this document as the modified Prism syntax highlighter is in use.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In the example I also removed prefixed attributes for brevity sake.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-css">code[class*="language-"],
pre[class*="language-"] {
  color: #657b83; /* base00 */
  /* add Recursive to the font stack */
  font-family: Recursive, Consolas, Monaco, 'Andale Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace;
  font-size: 1em;
  text-align: left;
  white-space: pre;
  word-spacing: normal;
  word-break: normal;
  word-wrap: normal;

  /* To handle variable font */
  font-weight: 400;
  font-variation-settings: "MONO" 1, "CASL" 0, "slnt" 0, "ital" 0.5;

  line-height: 1.5;

  /* Change tab size to 2*/
  tab-size: 2;

  hyphens: none;
}</code></pre>

    <h2 class="recursive-b025-sans-casual-black">
      How about longer text?
    </h2>

    <p>The following example uses the sans serif version of Recursive to layout a longer piece of content. It takes advantage of multiple predefined instances and classes to make a more playful reading experience.</p>

      <p class="centered"><strong>Card, Turning</strong></p>
      <p>
        The first time it happens, she’s in P.E. class, because of course it has
        to be P.E.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s fashionable to hate P.E., and most of the other girls at Mapletree
        Academy claim they do, but T.K. really doesn’t mind it. It’s only twice
        a week, and they mostly stick to sports she can do with her one working
        arm. She knows she could easily get out of P.E. by pulling the Cripple
        Card (although she never calls it that; her parents and teachers would
        flinch in horror at her own insensitivity toward <em>herself</em>, go
        figure), but she doesn’t because she likes to run around even if she’s
        not very good at it. She also doesn’t want to give her stuck-up
        classmates the satisfaction of being able to shoot her pitying glances
        as she sits on the sidelines and eats Goldfish crackers while doing her
        math homework. Truth be told: it’s the only time during the week when
        T.K. doesn’t feel like everyone’s pussyfooting around her disability.
      </p>
      <p>
        They’re playing dodgeball that day, at the end of the class. T.K. is
        pretty good at it considering she can only use one arm, even if she gets
        nailed by the ball a little more than the other girls. But this session
        is a shooting gallery, with her as the target. Again. It’s just two
        girls who are targeting her specifically—and her left side, too, where
        she can’t block—but they’re stealthy about it so Mrs. Williams, the P.E.
        teacher, doesn’t come down on them. For some reason, Brooke MacAllister
        has decided that if T.K. wants to play with the varsity, she can take
        the hits too. And for this week, she seems to have recruited Alison
        Keller to be her wingman, because T.K. is getting targeted fire from two
        angles. Mapletree has a special version of dodgeball where you have to
        crank out five push-ups on the spot if you get hit. Mrs. Williams wanted
        to give her a waiver on the push-ups, but T.K. refused the special
        treatment. She’s not strong enough for one-armed pushups, but she can do
        crunches just fine, so she does those instead. And today, she’s doing a
        lot of crunches courtesy of Brooke and Alison. In the middle of her
        fifth set, a ball comes in and beans her on the left side of the head
        just as she is coming up from a crunch.
      </p>
      <p>“Ow!”</p>
      <p>
        T.K. glares in the direction of the ball’s origin and spots Brooke, who
        gives her a curt and jock-like “Sorry!” without even the slightest tone
        of apology in her voice. T.K. doesn’t want to make anything of it, so
        she doesn’t even look for Mrs. Williams, but she has her limits, and
        Brooke’s attention is starting to poke at the edges of them. She
        finishes her crunches and gets back up to rejoin the ranks. Another ball
        shoots past her face, so close that she can practically smell the
        rubber, and she ducks and flinches. This one came from the other side of
        the court, from Alison’s direction, but Alison pretends to not notice
        T.K.’s glare as she conspicuously picks another target. T.K. grabs a
        ricochet off the gym floor and chucks it at Alison, but it misses her by
        a foot and smacks into the mats lining the wall behind her. Alison looks
        over to T.K. and smirks, which only serves to crank up the dial of
        T.K.’s Pissed-Off-O-Meter another notch. She can’t really complain about
        them throwing balls at her, because that’s what the game is about. But
        getting singled out for no good reason takes the fun out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        “One minute,” Mrs. Williams shouts from the sideline. “Wrap it up,
        ladies!” Then she turns around and checks her cell phone. T.K. groans.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Don’t you—” she calls over to Brooke, but Brooke does, and so does
        Alison. Of course they were waiting for the opportunity for one last
        cheap shot. Alison’s shot hits T.K.’s right thigh and bounces off.
        Brooke’s ball comes in a flat arc, and T.K. knows that she’ll take the
        stupid thing right on the bridge of her nose.
      </p>
      <p>That’s when the thing happens.</p>
      <p>
        Later, she’ll puzzle about what triggered it. She’s hot and sweaty,
        angry at Brooke and Alison, hurting from the shot to the bare skin of
        her leg, and the muscles on her left side, the one with the paralysis,
        are taut enough to snap, which is what happens when she overexerts
        herself. But she knows that she feels a swell of fresh anger, and
        something goes snap in her brain. There’s a hot, trickling sensation,
        like someone just opened the top of her skull and poured a cup of coffee
        directly on the back side of her brain and down her spinal column. T.K.
        raises her hand to keep the ball from hitting her in the face, even
        though she knows it’s too late for that. But then the strangest
        sensation follows the hot trickle. She can feel the ball not three feet
        in front of her face—its roundness, the way it displaces the air around
        it—and she gives it a tiny little shunt with her mind, and it’s the best
        feeling she’s ever had, like finally scratching an itch you couldn’t get
        to for an hour, only a hundred times better. The ball—the one that was
        about to give her a nosebleed—hooks ever so slightly to the left and
        whizzes past her left side, close enough to her ear that she can hear it
        whistling through the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobody notices. T.K. isn’t even sure that Brooke saw the ball didn’t fly
        true, that it made a little skip at the end of its arc. There are still
        half a dozen other balls in the air, and there’s a lot of movement and
        yelling, kids paying attention to throwing or not getting hit. But she
        is dead sure that she caused that little skip, because she knows that
        for just that half second, the ball was in her control, and that it went
        precisely where she had wanted it to go.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They hit the showers and get dressed, and T.K. is too amazed and shaken
        to seek out Brooke and Alison to bitch at them. Now that P.E. is over,
        nobody pays attention to her anymore. In the first few weeks after she
        joined the class, her awkward-looking one-handed maneuver to get back
        into her bra and shirt got some interest from the other girls in the
        locker room, but that’s old hat now, and she finishes up and leaves as
        quickly as she can.

    <h2 class="recursive-b025-sans-casual-black">How does it work at larger sizes?</h2>

    <p>I'm intrigued by the casual (CASL) axis in Recursive. Would it lend itself to large size display-type work?</p>

    <p>In the example below:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The first item uses the default sans serif boldfaced predefined axis</li>
      <li>The second one uses the casual boldfaced instance</li>
      <li>The last one uses the monospaced casual bold predefined instance</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example example3">
